## Overview
This session focused on enhancing the UI of the Adansi Edu Consult website, specifically improving the hero section slider and navigation bar. The goal was to create a modern, visually appealing interface with a clean slider design and a glassmorphic navbar.

## Key Changes Made

3. **Replaced original images** with new ones inspired by reference website
4. **Added a semi-transparent overlay** for better text readability
5. **Improved content positioning** with centered text and prominent CTAs
6. **Added subtle animations** for transitions between slides

### Navigation Bar Enhancements
1. **Created a glassmorphic effect** with semi-transparent background and backdrop blur
2. **Eliminated spacing** between navbar and hero section for seamless integration
3. **Implemented color transition** from transparent to white when scrolling
